# Search everywhere

The extension is inspired by JetBrains IDEs feature "Search Everywhere".
It allows user to easily navigate through files and symbols in the whole workspace.

It is the alternative for "Go to Symbol in Workspace..." - fully customizable.

<br/>
Brand new version - rewritten from scratch to be more flexible and smoother.

## How it works

After initialization the extension indexes the whole workspace. It scans both files and all symbols for each file according to set up patterns in settings.

After that, it listens for any change in the workplace, e.g.

* add, rename, delete function, variable or anything other in file
* add, rename, delete, move a file between directories or even between projects in the opened workspace

The above guarantees that the data is always up to date.

<br/>
Worth mentioning is the optimization of scanning algorithm. It queues every change and reduces not necessary actions to assure the scan is smooth and very quick.
